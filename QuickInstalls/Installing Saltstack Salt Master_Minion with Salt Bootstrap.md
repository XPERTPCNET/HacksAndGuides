# Installing Saltstack Salt Master/Minion with Salt Bootstrap
The Salt Bootstrap script allows for a user to install the Salt Minion or Master on a variety of system distributions and versions. This shell script known as bootstrap-salt.sh runs through a series of checks to determine the operating system type and version. It then installs the Salt binaries using the appropriate methods. The Salt Bootstrap script installs the minimum number of packages required to run Salt. This means that in the event you run the bootstrap to install via package, Git will not be installed. Installing the minimum number of packages helps ensure the script stays as lightweight as possible, assuming the user will install any other required packages after the Salt binaries are present on the system. The script source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap

### Using wget for stable branch
```
wget -O bootstrap_salt.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
```
### Using wget for development branch
```
wget -O bootstrap_salt.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com/develop
```

## Command Line Options:
```
$ sh bootstrap-salt.sh -h

  Usage :  bootstrap-salt.sh [options] <install-type> <install-type-args>

  Installation types:
    - stable (default)
    - stable [version] (ubuntu specific)
    - daily  (ubuntu specific)
    - testing (redhat specific)
    - git

  Examples:
    - bootstrap-salt.sh
    - bootstrap-salt.sh stable
    - bootstrap-salt.sh stable 2014.7
    - bootstrap-salt.sh daily
    - bootstrap-salt.sh testing
    - bootstrap-salt.sh git
    - bootstrap-salt.sh git develop
    - bootstrap-salt.sh git v0.17.0
    - bootstrap-salt.sh git 8c3fadf15ec183e5ce8c63739850d543617e4357

  Options:
  -h  Display this message
  -v  Display script version
  -n  No colours.
  -D  Show debug output.
  -c  Temporary configuration directory
  -g  Salt repository URL. (default: git://github.com/saltstack/salt.git)
  -G  Instead of cloning from git://github.com/saltstack/salt.git, clone from https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git (Usually necessary on systems which have the regular git protocol port blocked, where https usually is not)
  -k  Temporary directory holding the minion keys which will pre-seed
      the master.
  -s  Sleep time used when waiting for daemons to start, restart and when checking
      for the services running. Default: 3
  -M  Also install salt-master
  -S  Also install salt-syndic
  -N  Do not install salt-minion
  -X  Do not start daemons after installation
  -C  Only run the configuration function. This option automatically
      bypasses any installation.
  -P  Allow pip based installations. On some distributions the required salt
      packages or its dependencies are not available as a package for that
      distribution. Using this flag allows the script to use pip as a last
      resort method. NOTE: This only works for functions which actually
      implement pip based installations.
  -F  Allow copied files to overwrite existing(config, init.d, etc)
  -U  If set, fully upgrade the system prior to bootstrapping salt
  -K  If set, keep the temporary files in the temporary directories specified
      with -c and -k.
  -I  If set, allow insecure connections while downloading any files. For
      example, pass '--no-check-certificate' to 'wget' or '--insecure' to 'curl'
  -A  Pass the salt-master DNS name or IP. This will be stored under
      ${BS_SALT_ETC_DIR}/minion.d/99-master-address.conf
  -i  Pass the salt-minion id. This will be stored under
      ${BS_SALT_ETC_DIR}/minion_id
  -L  Install the Apache Libcloud package if possible(required for salt-cloud)
  -p  Extra-package to install while installing salt dependencies. One package
      per -p flag. You're responsible for providing the proper package name.
  -d  Disable check_service functions. Setting this flag disables the
      'install_<distro>_check_services' checks. You can also do this by
      touching /tmp/disable_salt_checks on the target host. Defaults ${BS_FALSE}
  -H  Use the specified http proxy for the installation
  -Z  Enable external software source for newer ZeroMQ(Only available for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Ubuntu based distributions)
  -b  Assume that dependencies are already installed and software sources are set up.
      If git is selected, git tree is still checked out as dependency step.
